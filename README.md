This is a project for Penn's [CIS 3500](https://togetherwe.dev/) intended to build understanding of static site generators and deployment pipelines.

This repository in particular will auto-deploy on a push to main, appearing at [nick-cirillo.github.io](https://nick-cirillo.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed), which redirects to my personal domain, [nicholascirillo.com](https://nicholascirillo.com/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed).
